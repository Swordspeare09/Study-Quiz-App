# Study-Quiz-App

This application was made for student looking for help increasing their knowledge on JavaScript fundamentals.
Although the application was not completely polished and button up, this Quiz application works all the same. 

This Study Quiz app consists of three web pages: The home page, The Game page, and the LeaderBoards page.
The Home page was made with nothing but HTML and CSS, and has links to the other two pages. 
The Game page uses JS functions to dynamically insert the questions into premade HTML tags and is styled using CSS and Bootsrap libraries. The LeaderBoards page also using JavaScript Object Notation functions to access and append objects stored in the local storage of the site to the page.

The Instructions for how to use this app are as follows:
Press Play on the Home Page.
Press start on the Game page.
Answer as many questions as you can in the alloated time.(Yes there is a timer on the screen)
When you are finshed with the Quiz or when the time expires, a prompt will record your name and your score and save it as an object in an array on the local storage.
When you wish to see your latest scores, press the LeaderBoards button on any on the other pages.

This Study Quiz will be improved in the future.
